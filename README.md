# Welcome to the Airbo interview ðŸŽ‰

The focus of the interview will be building a simple RESTful API and JS single-page application.

Please clone this repo, configure the database and add any gems you foresee needing, including your favorite test suite, so we can avoid spending shared time on configuration and database set up.

You will not be tested on configuration. For your convenience, React and jQuery have both been configured. Please feel free to use any, none or all of the JS frameworks configured in this project.
